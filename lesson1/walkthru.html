    <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> from a <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at <a href="https://launchschool.com">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?
    </p>
    <p class="last-two-paragraphs">
      There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML &amp; CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color that the first - the "class" attribute of the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.
    </p>
    <p class="last-two-paragraphs" id="last-paragraph">
      Ths is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as an `id` attribute to underline the entire paragraph.
