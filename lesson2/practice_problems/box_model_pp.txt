1.
- img
display = inline-block
box-sizing = content-box
rendered width  = 500 + 40 (padding) + 8 (border) + 30 (margin) = 578
rendered height = 300 + 20 (padding) + 8 (border) + 30 (margin) = 358
- because the div uses border-box sizing, must add 2px for its border, so
div width  = 580
div height = 360

2.
- section
display = block
- from the posted solution,
"Since the section element is a block element" ...
"other elements may appear adjacent to the img in problem 1, while the section in this problem will always be on a line by itself within the div no matter its width."

3.
- em
display = inline
- since the em elem is inline, the div only needs to be large enough to contain the
  - content
  - padding and border
  - left and right margins
of the em, plus 2px height and width for its own border

4.
- article
display = inline-block
box-sizing = border-box
- since the padding and border of the article are contained w/i its spec'd size, its
rendered width  = 500 + 30 (margin) = 530
rendered height = 300 + 30 (margin) = 330
- because the div uses border-box sizing, must add 2px for its border, so
div width  = 532
div height = 332

i. no; block elems always appear on their own line
ii. yes; rendered width for the tags is AT MOST 360px, since both use border-box and their margin is 0, so they can be contained within the div's 720px width
iii. yes; will behave as per ii, since horiz space is avail
iv. no; as per i
v. no; as per i
vi. yes; the inline-block elem will behave as per an inline elem, since horiz space is avail

6.
- the article will inherit the content-box sizing of its parent unless otherwise spec'd
- since its width is spec'd at 50%, the additional space needed for its padding and border will exceed the avail width of the div when placed w/ another article of the same type
- to fix, spec
box-sizing: border-box
display: inline-block

7.
- makes no difference ?
- the 2 articles are still both located w/i the same section
- from the solution, the whitespace between the 2 lines is perceived as a single char, which takes up space (thus exceeding the 100% width of the section elem)
- so the articles cannot appear on the same line
